        <h1>Solar Panels</h1>

        <p>
            Solar panels are devices that convert the sun's rays into electricity.
            They are made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are made from semiconducting materials like silicon.
            When light hits a PV cell, it excites the electrons in the material,
            causing them to flow through the material and create an electrical current.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cost of solar panels varies depending on several factors, including the size of the system,
            the type and quality of the equipment, and the installation costs.
            According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA),
            the average cost of solar panels in the United States is around $3 per watt.
            For a typical residential solar panel system,
            the total cost is usually in the range of $15,000 to $25,000.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fortunately, there are various incentives available to homeowners who want to install solar panels.
            One of the most significant incentives is the federal investment tax credit (ITC),
            which allows homeowners to deduct 26% of the cost of their solar panel system from their federal taxes.
            Additionally, many states offer their own incentives, such as tax credits,
            rebates, and net metering laws,
            which allow homeowners to sell excess energy generated by their solar panels back to the grid.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most significant benefits of solar panels is their positive impact on the environment.
            Solar energy is a clean and renewable source of energy,
            meaning it does not produce any harmful emissions or pollutants like fossil fuels do.
            According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
            greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are a significant contributor to climate change,
            and renewable energy sources like solar power can help reduce these emissions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Solar panels can also increase the value of a home.
            According to a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL),
            homes with solar panels sell for a premium compared to similar homes without solar panels.
            The study found that homeowners can recover up to 100%
            of their solar panel investment through the increased home value.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to the financial benefits, solar panels can also provide energy independence.
            When paired with energy storage systems like batteries,
            solar panels can provide a reliable source of power during power outages and reduce reliance on the grid.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, solar panels offer many benefits, including cost savings, environmental benefits,
            increased home value, and energy independence.
            With various incentives available,
            now is a great time for homeowners to consider investing in solar panels for their homes.
