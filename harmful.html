    <h2>Fossil Fuels</h2>
    <p>     
        Fossil fuels are created by the remains of ancient animals and plants.
        They are very popular as they were the primary resource to fuel the energy of our everyday lifestyle.
        Fossil fuels have helped power our electricity, vehicles, and even home appliances.
        As much as we use fossil fuels for good,
        they have an enormous toll on the environment as they play a huge part in air/water pollution and climate change.
        The most common fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas as they have the most high carbon content.
        Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air, leading to play a significant part in global warning and its associated consequences.
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>Coal</summary>
        <p>
            Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel that can burned.
            It is a solid, carbon-heavy rock that comes in many variations and is extracted in two different ways.
            One way to extract coal is by using heavy machinery in underground caves to find deep underground coal deposits.
            Another way to extract coal is by surface mining, which is also known as strip mining.
            Strip mining removes layers of soil and rock to access coal deposits.
            Most coal in the United States is extracted by the method of strip mining.
            As both methods of mining coal are detrimental to the environment,
            strip mining is more destructive as it uproots and pollutes entire ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
            A third of residents' electricity is run on the burning of coal.
            As coal does come in four variations, the most common burned in the United States is sub-bituminous or bituminous.
            The cost of sub-bituminous coal is $14.18 per ton as the cost of bituminous coal is $61.28.
            Each tone weighs about 2,000 pounds. To put it in perspective, 9,000 tonnes of coal per day is required to power a power plant.
            Not only do you have to pay for the coal to power electricity, but it also cost to ship the coal to the power plants.
            The average annual prices of coal delivered to end-use sectors from 2012-2021 varied.
            In 2012, the cost to deliver coal was $45.77 per short ton for the use of electric power.
            The cost then decreased over the years, making the price of delivery in 2021 being $37.32 per short ton.

        <summary>Oil</summary> 
        <p>
            Crude oil (aka petroleum) is a liquid fossil fuel made up mostly of hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon compounds).
            It can be found in underground reservoirs; in the cracks, crevices, and pores of sedimentary rock.
            Oil is extracted by the drilling on land and sea or by strip mining in tar sands oil and oil shade.
            When drilling, the most common method is horizontal drilling.
            This allows to gather more oil and gas by fracking.
            Fracking involves  blasting huge quantities of water, that is mixed with chemicals and sand, 
            deep into a well with high enough pressures to fracture rock and enable the oil or gas to escape.
            This method is known for creating environmental and health problems, including air and water pollution.
            Once extracted, oil is transported via vehicles and pipelines so that it can be transformed into usable fuels such as gasoline,
            propane, and jet fuelâ€”as well as products such as plastics and paint.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oil makes up 35% of United States resident's electricity.
            Oil
            Using clean/green practices is strongly encouraged to reduce oil consumption.

        <summary>Natural Gas</summary>
        <p>Natural Gas is mostly made of methane and also known as fracked gas.
        It can be considered either conventional or unconventional, depending on where it is located underground.
        Conventional Natural Gas is found in porous and permeable rock beds or mixed into oil reservoirs.
        It can be extracted by regular drilling.
        Unconventional Natural Gas is found in more difficult places that require being extracted by fracking, which makes it more expensive.
        Natural Gas is the largest source of energy for electricity in the United States as it contributes to 38% of citizen's energy needs.

    <h2>Carbon Emission</h2>
    <p>
        Carbon emissions have a significant impact on the environment, contributing to climate change and air pollution.
        The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,
        leading to global warming and its associated consequences, including rising sea levels, more frequent and intense weather events,
        and negative impacts on human health. To prevent or reduce carbon emissions, various measures can be taken,
        such as transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power,
        improving energy efficiency in buildings and transportation,
        and implementing policies like carbon pricing or cap-and-trade systems.
        According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
        in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,
        greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.
        The costs of reducing carbon emissions will vary depending on the specific measures implemented,
        but according to the World Bank, the benefits of reducing carbon emissions,
        including improved air quality and health, can outweigh the costs.

    <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
    <p>
    Water pollution is a serious environmental issue that affects not only the health of our waterways,
    but also the health of the animals and humans that rely on them.
    The energy sector is a major contributor to water pollution,
    as power plants and other energy-related facilities often release harmful pollutants into waterways.
    According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
    the energy sector is responsible for approximately 30% of all water pollution in the United States.
    This pollution can have serious consequences, including the death of aquatic life,
    the contamination of drinking water sources, and the destruction of habitats.
    In addition to the environmental costs, water pollution can also have significant economic costs.
    For example, the EPA estimates that the total cost of water pollution in the United States is approximately $4.3 billion annually.
    This includes the costs of cleaning up pollution, restoring habitats, and lost revenue from recreational activities.
    To address these issues, many green energy initiatives are being promoted by the EPA and other organizations.
    These initiatives aim to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and promote the use of renewable energy sources,
    such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. By using these clean energy sources,
    we can reduce the amount of water pollution caused by the energy sector.
    Additionally, many states offer tax rebates and other incentives for homeowners who install green energy solutions,
    such as solar panels or wind turbines, in their homes.
    These incentives can help offset the upfront costs of these systems and make them more accessible to homeowners.

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>To reduce carbon emissions, we can transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power,
       improve energy efficiency, and implement policies like carbon pricing or cap-and-trade systems.
       According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
       greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050
       to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
       To address these issues, many green energy initiatives are being promoted
       to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and promote the use of renewable energy sources.
       Additionally, land degradation has significant economic consequences,
       costing the global economy around $23 billion annually.
       It also reduces the availability of land for renewable energy sources.
       Governments and organizations are promoting green energy initiatives
       that encourage the use of renewable energy sources and sustainable land management practices.
       By promoting sustainable practices and green energy initiatives,
       we can reduce the negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment and promote a more sustainable future.
