    <h2>Fossil Fuels</h2>
    <p>
        Fossil fuels are created by the remains of ancient animals and plants.
        They are very popular as they were the primary resource to fuel the energy of our everyday lifestyle.
        Fossil fuels have helped power our electricity, vehicles, and even home appliances.
        As much as we use fossil fuels for good,
        they have an enormous toll on the environment as they play a huge part in air/water pollution and climate change.
        The most common fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas as they have the most high carbon content.

            Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel that can burned.
            It is a solid, carbon-heavy rock that comes in many variations and is extracted in two different ways.
            One way to extract coal is by using heavy machinery in underground caves to find deep underground coal deposits.
            Another way to extract coal is by surface mining, which is also known as strip mining.
            Strip mining removes layers of soil and rock to access coal deposits.
            Most coal in the United States is extracted by the method of strip mining.
            As both methods of mining coal are detrimental to the environment,
            strip mining is more destructive as it uproots and pollutes entire ecosystems.
            <br>
            <br>
            A third of residents' electricity is run on the burning of coal.
            As coal does come in four variations, the most common burned in the United States is sub-bituminous or bituminous.
            The cost of sub-bituminous coal is $14.18 per ton as the cost of bituminous coal is $61.28.
            Each tone weighs about 2,000 pounds. To put it in perspective, 9,000 tonnes of coal per day is required to power a power plant.
            Not only do you have to pay for the coal to power electricity, but it also cost to ship the coal to the power plants.
            The average annual prices of coal delivered to end-use sectors from 2012-2021 varied.
            In 2012, the cost to deliver coal was $45.77 per short ton for the use of electric power.
            The cost then decreased over the years, making the price of delivery in 2021 being $37.32 per short ton.

        <dt>Oil</dt> 
        <dd>
            Crude oil (aka petroleum) is a liquid fossil fuel made up mostly of hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon compounds).
            It can be found in underground reservoirs; in the cracks, crevices, and pores of sedimentary rock.
            Oil is extracted by the drilling on land and sea or by strip mining in tar sands oil and oil shade.
            When drilling, the most common method is horizontal drilling.
            This allows to gather more oil and gas by fracking.
            Fracking involves  blasting huge quantities of water, that is mixed with chemicals and sand, 
            deep into a well with high enough pressures to fracture rock and enable the oil or gas to escape.
            This method is known for creating environmental and health problems, including air and water pollution.
            Once extracted, oil is transported via vehicles and pipelines so that it can be transformed into usable fuels such as gasoline,
            propane, and jet fuelâ€”as well as products such as plastics and paint.
            <br>
            <br>
            Oil makes up 35% of United States resident's electricity. Cost of oil being used for electricity and cost of transporting oil.
