            <h2>Fossil Fuels</h2>
            <p>
                Fossil fuels are created by the remains of ancient animals and plants.
                They are very popular as they were the primary resource to fuel the energy of our everyday lifestyle.
                Fossil fuels have helped power our electricity, vehicles, and even home appliances.
                As much as we use fossil fuels for good,
                they have an enormous toll on the environment as they play a huge part in air/water pollution and
                climate change.
                The most common fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas as they have the most high carbon content.
                Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air, leading to play a significant
                part in global warning and its associated consequences.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Coal</summary>
                <p>
                    Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel that can burned.
                    It is a solid, carbon-heavy rock that comes in many variations and is extracted in two different
                    ways.
                    One way to extract coal is by using heavy machinery in underground caves to find deep underground
                    coal deposits.
                    Another way to extract coal is by surface mining, which is also known as strip mining.
                    Strip mining removes layers of soil and rock to access coal deposits.
                    Most coal in the United States is extracted by the method of strip mining.
                    As both methods of mining coal are detrimental to the environment,
                    strip mining is more destructive as it uproots and pollutes entire ecosystems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A third of residents' electricity is run on the burning of coal.
                    As coal does come in four variations, the most common burned in the United States is sub-bituminous
                    or bituminous.
                    The cost of sub-bituminous coal is $14.18 USD per ton as the cost of bituminous coal is $61.28 USD.
                    Each tone weighs about 2,000 pounds. To put it in perspective, 9,000 tonnes of coal per day is
                    required to power a power plant.
                    Not only do you have to pay for the coal to power electricity, but it also cost to ship the coal to
                    the power plants.
                    The average annual prices of coal delivered to end-use sectors from 2012-2021 varied.
                    In 2012, the cost to deliver coal was $45.77 USD per short ton for the use of electric power.
                    The cost then decreased over the years, making the price of delivery in 2021 being $37.32 USD per
                    short ton.
                    The cost of coal varied as the years went on.
                    In the first month of 2020, the price of coal was $45.55 USD per ton; each ton consist of 1,000
                    kilograms of coal.
                    The price of coal in the beginning of the year 2023 is $177.75 USD per ton.

                <summary>Oil</summary>
                <p>
                    Crude oil (aka petroleum) is a liquid fossil fuel made up mostly of hydrocarbons (hydrogen and
                    carbon compounds).
                    It can be found in underground reservoirs; in the cracks, crevices, and pores of sedimentary rock.
                    Oil is extracted by the drilling on land and sea or by strip mining in tar sands oil and oil shade.
                    When drilling, the most common method is horizontal drilling.
                    This allows to gather more oil and gas by fracking.
                    Fracking involves blasting huge quantities of water, that is mixed with chemicals and sand,
                    deep into a well with high enough pressures to fracture rock and enable the oil or gas to escape.
                    This method is known for creating environmental and health problems, including air and water
                    pollution.
                    Once extracted, oil is transported via vehicles and pipelines so that it can be transformed into
                    usable fuels such as gasoline,
                    propane, and jet fuel—as well as products such as plastics and paint.
                    Using clean/green practices is strongly encouraged to reduce oil consumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oil makes up 35% of United States resident's electricity.
                    It is transported various ways which are priced differently.
                    Transporting oil through pipelines is the cheapest way as it only cost between $2-$4 USD per barrel.
                    The most expensive way to transport oil is by rail which cost between $10-$15 USD per barrel.
                    Over time, and due to inflation, oil prices have sky rocked to very high prices.
                    In early 2020, the cost of oil was $59.56 USD per barrel.
                    The highest peak in oil prices was June 2022 as the price was $121.51 USD per barrel.
                    The price of early 2023 was $73.67 USD and has varied ever since.

                <summary>Natural Gas</summary>
                <p>Natural Gas is mostly made of methane and also known as fracked gas.
                    It can be considered either conventional or unconventional, depending on where it is located
                    underground.
                    Conventional Natural Gas is found in porous and permeable rock beds or mixed into oil reservoirs.
                    It can be extracted by regular drilling.
                    Unconventional Natural Gas is found in more difficult places that require being extracted by
                    fracking, which makes it more expensive.
                    Natural Gas is the largest source of energy for electricity in the United States as it contributes
                    to 38% of citizen's energy needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prices of Natural Gas were low for a few years but prices started to increase at a high rate by the
                    end of 2021.
                    A possible cause could be due to inflation in the country.
                    In 2020, the cost of natural gas was $2.17 USD per MMBtu.
                    Prices rose to $6.31 USD per in October 2021.
                    Natural Gas hit it's highest price of $9.33 USD per MMBtu in August 2022.
                    By early 2023, prices went back down to $3.71 USD per MMBtu.
                    To use Natural Gas as a source of energy, it has to be distributed via pipeline.
                    The cost of constructing gas pipeline ranged from $5.5 million -$13.14 million USD per mile.
                    The pipelines would range from 118-600 miles in length.

        <h2>Carbon Emission</h2>
        <p>
            Carbon emissions have a significant impact on the environment, contributing to climate change and air
            pollution.
            The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
            into the atmosphere,
            leading to global warming and its associated consequences, including rising sea levels, more frequent and
            intense weather events,
            and negative impacts on human health. To prevent or reduce carbon emissions, various measures can be taken,
            such as transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power,
            improving energy efficiency in buildings and transportation,
            and implementing policies like carbon pricing or cap-and-trade systems.
            According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
            in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,
            greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.
            The costs of reducing carbon emissions will vary depending on the specific measures implemented,
            but according to the World Bank, the benefits of reducing carbon emissions,
            including improved air quality and health, can outweigh the costs.
        </p>

        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>
            Water pollution is a serious environmental issue that affects not only the health of our waterways,
            but also the health of the animals and humans that rely on them.
            The energy sector is a major contributor to water pollution,
            as power plants and other energy-related facilities often release harmful pollutants into waterways.
            According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
            the energy sector is responsible for approximately 30% of all water pollution in the United States.
            This pollution can have serious consequences, including the death of aquatic life,
            the contamination of drinking water sources, and the destruction of habitats.
            In addition to the environmental costs, water pollution can also have significant economic costs.
            For example, the EPA estimates that the total cost of water pollution in the United States is approximately
            $4.3 billion annually.
            This includes the costs of cleaning up pollution, restoring habitats, and lost revenue from recreational
            activities.
            To address these issues, many green energy initiatives are being promoted by the EPA and other
            organizations.
            These initiatives aim to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and promote the use of renewable energy
            sources,
            such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. By using these clean energy sources,
            we can reduce the amount of water pollution caused by the energy sector.
            Additionally, many states offer tax rebates and other incentives for homeowners who install green energy
            solutions,
            such as solar panels or wind turbines, in their homes.
            These incentives can help offset the upfront costs of these systems and make them more accessible to
            homeowners.
        </p>

        <h2>Land Degradation</h2>
        <p>Unearthing, processing, and moving fossil fuels takes an enormous toll on our landscapes and ecosystems.
            The fossil fuel industry leases a huge amount of of land to build infrastructures that help the proccess of
            using fossil fuels.
            These infrastructures being built include wells, pipelines, and access roads, as well as facilities for
            processing, waste storage, and waste disposal.
            While during the process of strip mining, huge amounts of terrain—including forests and whole
            mountaintops—are scraped and blasted away during the extraction of getting underground fossil fuels.
            Even after strip-mining operations stopped, the land will never return to what it once was.
            As a result, wildlife habitats (that are used for breeding and migration) end up fragmented and destroyed.
            Animals end up suffering as they are forced into a less-than-ideal habitat and must compete with existing
            wildlife for resources.
