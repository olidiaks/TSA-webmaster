Reducing our consumption of natural resources is an important step in minimizing our impact on the environment. One way to reduce our carbon footprint is by using energy-efficient appliances and lighting. Energy Star, a program run by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), helps consumers identify energy-efficient products that meet strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the EPA. These products include lighting, ceiling fans, and home appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and heaters.

According to Energy Star, replacing traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs can save homeowners $30 to $80 per year on their energy bills. In addition, Energy Star certified appliances use less energy and water than traditional models, saving homeowners money on their utility bills while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
    </p>

    <p>
The cost of Energy Star certified appliances varies depending on the product and brand. However, many utility companies offer rebates and incentives to homeowners who purchase energy-efficient appliances, which can help offset the cost. For example, according to the Energy Star website, homeowners in Texas can receive up to $250 in rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances.
