        <h1>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h1>
        <h2>Reduce</h2>

        <p>
            Reducing our consumption of natural resources is an important step in minimizing our impact on the
            environment.
            One way to reduce our carbon footprint is by using energy-efficient appliances and lighting. Energy Star, a
            program run by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), helps consumers identify energy-efficient
            products that meet strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the EPA. These products include lighting,
            ceiling
            fans, and home appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and heaters.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to Energy Star, replacing traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs can
            save homeowners $30 to $80 per year on their energy bills. In addition, Energy Star certified appliances use
            less energy and water than traditional models, saving homeowners money on their utility bills while also
            reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cost of Energy Star certified appliances varies depending on the product and brand. However, many
            utility
            companies offer rebates and incentives to homeowners who purchase energy-efficient appliances, which can
            help
            offset the cost. For example, according to the Energy Star website, homeowners in Texas can receive up to
            $250
            in rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances.
        </p>

        <h2>Reuse</h2>

        <p>
            Reusing materials and products is another way to reduce waste and minimize our impact on the environment.
            One
            way to do this is by repurposing items that would otherwise be thrown away. For example, old pallets can be
            used
            to create planters, shelves, or even furniture.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another way to reuse materials is by donating items that are still in good condition to charity or thrift
            stores. This not only reduces waste but also helps support local communities. Many organizations, such as
            Habitat for Humanity ReStores, accept donations of gently used building materials, appliances, and
            furniture,
            and sell them at discounted prices to support affordable housing initiatives.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, many cities and towns have implemented curbside recycling programs that allow residents to
            recycle
            a variety of materials, including paper, plastic, glass, and metal. By reusing and recycling these
            materials, we
            can reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and conserve natural resources.
        </p>

        <h2>Recycle</h2>

        <p>
            Recycling is an important part of reducing waste and conserving natural resources. Many cities and towns
            have
            implemented curbside recycling programs that allow residents to recycle a variety of materials, including
            paper,
            plastic, glass, and metal. In addition, many retailers and manufacturers offer recycling programs for
            specific
            products, such as electronics, batteries, and toner cartridges.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), recycling helps to conserve natural resources,
            reduce
            landfill waste, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. For example, recycling aluminum cans uses 95% less
            energy
            than producing new aluminum from raw materials.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cost of recycling programs varies depending on the location and the materials being recycled. However,
            many
            cities and towns offer curbside recycling programs at no additional cost to residents. In addition, some
            retailers and manufacturers offer incentives for recycling, such as discounts on new products or rewards
            points.
