        <h1>Harmful Activities</h1>
        <p>
           Over the years, fossil fuels have been used as a primary energy source for United States citizens.
           According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 80% of energy needs are used by fossil fuels.
           As much as they are popularly used, they are detrimental to the environment.
           They lead to many harmful activities that are very impactful on Earth's condition like carbon emission, water pollution, and land degradation.
