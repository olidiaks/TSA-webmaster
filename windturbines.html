        <h1>Wind Turbines</h1>
        <p>Green energy initiatives are important to reduce the negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment. One
            such initiative is the use of wind turbines, which convert wind energy into electricity. But what do wind
            turbines do, how much do they cost, and what tax rebates are available for them?
        </p>
        <p>Wind turbines work by using blades to capture the wind and turn it into rotational energy, which is then
            converted into electricity by a generator. They can be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire
            cities. According to the American Wind Energy Association, wind turbines can reduce carbon emissions by 60
            million cars' worth of emissions each year.
        </p>
        <p>The cost of wind turbines varies depending on their size and location. Small, residential wind turbines can
            cost anywhere from $8,000 to $20,000, while larger, commercial turbines can cost upwards of $2 million. The
            operation and maintenance of wind turbines also incurs additional costs, ranging from $42,000 to $48,000 per
            year for a typical 2-3 MW turbine.
        </p>
        <p>Fortunately, there are tax rebates available for individuals and businesses who invest in wind turbines. The
            Production Tax Credit (PTC) is a federal incentive that provides a tax credit of 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour
            of electricity produced by a wind turbine. Additionally, many states offer their own incentives, such as
            rebates, tax credits, and property tax exemptions.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the upfront costs, wind turbines can be a smart investment for those looking to reduce their carbon
            footprint and energy bills. According to the US Department of Energy, wind energy can save consumers money
            by reducing the amount of energy that needs to be generated from fossil fuels. In fact, wind energy can
            reduce electricity prices by as much as $10 billion per year.
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion, wind turbines are an important tool in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting
            green energy. While they can be expensive, tax rebates and incentives can help offset the costs. As
            technology continues to improve, the efficiency and affordability of wind turbines are likely to increase,
            making them an even more attractive option for those looking to go green.
